# Go Microservices Project

This project was developed while following the course **[Build a Microservice with Go](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/build-a-microservice-with-go/go-for-microservices)** on LinkedIn Learning.  
The goal is to learn how to create and run a simple **CRUD REST API** in Go within a microservices environment using Postgres, Docker and Docker Compose.

The service is built with:
- [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) â€” Web framework for building APIs
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/) â€” ORM library for database operations
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) â€” Relational database for persistence

## ðŸš€ Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
